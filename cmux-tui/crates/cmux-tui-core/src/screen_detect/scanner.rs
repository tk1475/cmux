//! Daemon-side screen-detection scanner.
//!
//! Detection semantics derived from herdr (https://github.com/herdrdev/herdr),
//! Apache-2.0, commit 7b675f42af35, modified by manaflow.
//!
//! One session-owned thread samples every live PTY's coalesced output
//! revision on a fixed cadence. A terminal that stays on one revision for
//! the debounce window is quiesced: its foreground process name picks a
//! manifest and the viewport tail plus OSC title are evaluated. The
//! tracker turns per-scan states into edge-triggered journal emissions.
