# cmux Cloud CLI reference

Every verb the cmux CLI exposes for cmux Cloud, as it exists on this branch. `cmux cloud` is an alias for `cmux vm` (`cmux cloud ls` == `cmux vm self`). Verbs that exist only in an open PR are listed at the end under [In flight](#in-flight) and nowhere else, so nothing above that heading is something you cannot run today. `tests/test_cloud_vm_skill_coverage.py` fails CI when this file and `CLI/cmux.swift` disagree.

## Conventions

- **Requires** the cmux app running on the Mac, a signed-in account (`cmux auth status`), and the WireGuard tunnel up (`cmux vpn up`) — machines live on a private per-user network with no public ports, so attach/exec/port verbs need it. Every verb talks to the app over its Unix socket (`CMUX_SOCKET_PATH` when set; the app's default socket otherwise) — the app, not the CLI, holds the cloud credentials. The guest `cmux self` and `cmux vm self` commands are the exception: they run inside a machine through its edge-injected credential.
- **`--json`** is a global flag: it may appear before or after the subcommand and prints the socket payload (or the CLI's own summary object, noted per verb) instead of text. Parse JSON, never the human tables.
- **`--help` / `-h`** works offline (no app needed). `cmux vm --help` is the overview; `cmux vm run --help`, `route`, `agent`, `push`, `pull`, `wait`, `open`, `tree`, `workspace`, `terminal`, `tui`, `prompt`, `base`, and `domains` print that verb's own options (`cmux vm terminal --help` covers close, send, read, and wait). `resize` is documented in the overview because its compact validation usage is emitted inline. Anything after `--` is never treated as a help flag (`cmux vm exec <id> -- --help` runs `--help` on the machine).
- **Exit codes:** `0` success; `1` any error (socket missing, backend error, usage error, unknown `vm` verb); `2` missing or unknown top-level command. `cmux vm run` exits with the **remote command's exit code**; `cmux vm exec` prints `exit <n>` to stderr and exits `1` when the remote command fails; `cmux vm wait` and `cmux vm terminal wait` exit `1` on timeout (or a failed machine).
- **Ids:** a machine's generated name (`brave-otter`) is its id everywhere; the display label from `vm rename` is cosmetic. Workspace ids are `ws_…`, terminal ids `term_…` (both from `cmux vm tree`). `--window <id|ref|index>` on the opening verbs picks the local window; `--workspace <id|ref|index>` the local workspace.
- **Env:** `CMUX_VM_API_BASE_URL` overrides the backend origin (dev stacks). `HOME` is honored for the router's state files (`~/.cmuxterm/vm-run-pool.json`, `~/.cmuxterm/vm-run-bindings.json`).

For a first run, use this read-only preflight before provisioning anything:

```bash
cmux auth status
cmux vm ls --json
cmux vm route --json
cmux vm tree --json
cmux auth status                       # signed in?
cmux vm ls                             # NAME / LABEL / STATE / PROVIDER / IMAGE + plan meter (+ free-window countdown)
cmux vm ls --json                      # {vms: [{id, status, image, createdAt, freeAccessExpiresAt, capabilities: {ports, …}}], limits: {maxActiveVms, planId, memoryOptionsMb, freeAccessWindowDays, freeAccessExpiresAt}}
cmux vpn status                        # this build's WireGuard tunnel to its private machine network (machines open no public port): up, down, or up for another enrollment (stale)
cmux vpn up                            # enroll this Mac and bring the tunnel up (sudo); a stale tunnel (rotated keys) is replaced. One tunnel per deployment (`cmux` for production, `cmux-staging`/`cmux-dev` for dev builds), so a dev build and the production app can both be up
cmux vpn down                          # take this build's tunnel down (sudo)
cmux self                              # INSIDE a machine: this machine's name, id, status, team (--json: {schema, machine, team, machines}); guest `cmux vm self` lists the team's machines with this one marked *
cmux vm tree                           # the surface catalog: This Mac (terminals by workspace, browsers), then every machine → Workspaces, Ports, VNC Displays, Terminals
cmux vm tree <id> --refresh            # one machine (`local` for This Mac), re-synced first
cmux vm workspace new <id> [--name n]  # a new cmux-tui workspace on the machine (⌘N there), opened as a new local workspace
cmux vm workspace open <id> <ws-id>    # open a machine workspace as a NEW local workspace: one pane per terminal/browser (clicking its row)
cmux vm workspace open <id> <ws-id> --here [--workspace <local>]      # into the current local workspace: one pane + the rest as tabs (drop a workspace row onto a pane)
cmux vm workspace open <id> <ws-id> --tabs [--pane <p>]                # all as tabs of the focused/--pane pane (CLI placement)
cmux vm workspace open <id> <ws-id> --pane <p> --left|--right|--up|--down   # what dropping the row on that pane edge does
cmux vm workspace rename <id> <ws-id> <name>   # rename that workspace (the row's "Rename…")
cmux vm workspace close <id> <ws-id>   # CLI-only: close that workspace but keep its terminals running in the Terminals pool
cmux vm workspace rm <id> <ws-id>      # close that workspace AND kill every terminal in it (the row's "Close Workspace…" / hover ×). Permanent.
cmux vm terminal close <id> <term-id>  # end one terminal on the machine (the sidebar's ×); its local panes close too
cmux vm terminal send <id> <term-id> [text] [--keys enter,ctrl+c,…]   # type into the terminal headlessly (as-is, no newline), then press named keys (chords join with +); no pane, no focus
cmux vm terminal read <id> <term-id>   # the visible screen as text (--json: + rows, cols, cursor)
cmux vm terminal wait <id> <term-id> --pattern <regex> [--timeout <s>]   # block until the screen matches (default 30 s); exit 1 on timeout
cmux vm tree --json                    # {machines: [{id, local, name, status, link_state, …}], resources: [{id, machine, kind, key, title, detail, lifecycle, agent, remote_workspace, port, url, open, open_surface_ids}], projections: […]}
cmux surface ls [--json]               # same catalog; `surface open <resource>` / `surface new-terminal --machine <m>` are the generic verbs
cmux vm status <id>                    # provider, status, image
cmux vm stats <id>                     # CPU/mem/disk now; sleeping machines stay asleep
cmux vm resize <id> --disk 40G         # grow persistent disk in 4 GiB steps (never shrinks)
cmux vm tools <id>                     # which tools are installed
cmux vm ports <id>                     # listening TCP ports inside the machine
cmux vm handoff <id>                   # short attach block to paste to a human or another agent
```

Only then choose `vm run`/`vm agent` (router-managed work), `vm base open`
(the persistent personal machine), or an explicit `vm new`. Use `--json` for
automation and the human output when teaching a person what to click or copy.

## Machines

### `cmux vm self`

```bash
cmux vm ls [--json]                    # alias: cmux vm list
```

Socket `vm.list`. Text: a `NAME  LABEL  STATE  PROVIDER  IMAGE` table, then the plan meter (`N of M machines on the <plan> plan` when `limits.maxActiveVms` is set, `N machines on the <plan> plan, no limit` when it is absent) and, on free plans, when free cloud access expires. Empty: `No cloud VMs. Try: cmux vm new`.
`--json`: `{vms: [{id, displayName?, status, provider, image, kind?, capabilities?: {snapshot, fork}, createdAt?, freeAccessExpiresAt?}], limits: {maxActiveVms, planId, memoryOptionsMb?, freeAccessWindowDays?, freeAccessExpiresAt?}, imageKinds?}`. Sidebar: the Machines panel list.

### Lifecycle and safety

Create a machine only after `vm ls` shows the available plan capacity. A bare
`vm new` provisions the devbox with displays. The legacy `--base`,
`--no-desktop`, and `--desktop` flags remain accepted but all select that same devbox. Use
`--detach` for a headless create, then wait for readiness before the first
command:

```bash
cmux vm ls --json
cmux vm new --detach --name "build box" --size 8g --json
cmux vm wait <machine> --wake
cmux vm status <machine>
```

Named sizes are `4g`, `8g`, `16g`, `24g`, `32g`, and `64g`; a raw memory value
in MB is also parsed. Read `vm ls --json` → `limits.memoryOptionsMb` for the
current plan's choices. The server uses its plan default when a parsed request
is not allowed; the chosen image supplies the matching CPU and initial disk.
`--name` changes the display label, never the generated machine id. Prefer a
workspace on an existing machine for another task; use `vm fork` for an
isolated experiment. `vm rm` permanently deletes the machine and its volume,
so only remove a machine created for the current task and ask before touching
someone else's machine or Base.

### `cmux vm new`

```bash
cmux vm new [--desktop|--base] [--size <4g|8g|16g|24g|32g|64g|MB>] [--name <label>] [--provider <p>] [--image <id>] [--workspace <id>] [--window <id|ref|index>] [--focus <true|false>] [--detach|-d] [--json]
# alias: cmux vm create
```

Socket `vm.create` with `kind: desktop` for every new machine. The legacy `--base`/`--no-desktop` and `--desktop` flags all select the same devbox; contradictory flags are rejected. The backend selects the image from its manifest; `--image <id>` is the explicit override and the only way an image id leaves the client. If the requested kind is not offered, the server fails closed with an image-config error rather than silently returning the wrong shape. `--size` accepts `4g`, `8g`, `16g`, `24g`, `32g`, `64g`, or raw MB ≥ 512. `vm ls --json` → `limits.memoryOptionsMb` is authoritative for the current plan; the backend selects its default when a parsed request is unavailable, and the chosen image supplies the matching CPU and initial disk. `--name` applies a display label through `vm.rename` after the create. Positional arguments are rejected (`cmux vm new myvm` errors instead of provisioning). Retries of a failed create reuse an idempotency key so a transient failure never mints two machines.
Without `--detach`, opens a plain terminal on the machine (the same open path as `vm shell`); `--focus false` opens it without switching to its workspace (what the New Machine sheet does — the app's Create returns control immediately and the pane appears in the background); desktop machines also get their screen in a split. Text output carries the stable `OK machine=<id>` marker after the localized created line; `--detach` prints `<id> is ready` and the follow-up commands. `--json`: the `vm.create` payload (`{id, provider, image, kind?, …}`) and no pane. Sidebar: Machines panel ＋ / "New Cloud Machine…" sheet (name, size, plan meter). On a free or unknown plan the backend returns `vm_requires_pro` (exit 1); paid-plan machine caps come from the backend (`vm ls --json` → `limits.maxActiveVms`; absent means uncapped). The current CLI accepts `--provider freestyle`; omit it to let the server choose the configured default. If a deployment adds another provider, read that tagged app's `vm new --help` before using it.

### `cmux vm rename`

```bash
cmux vm rename <id> <label> [--json]
cmux vm rename <id> --clear [--json]
```

Sets or clears the machine's display-only label through `vm.rename`; the generated machine id remains its address. The response is JSON when requested, otherwise it confirms the stored label.

### `cmux vm rm`

```bash
cmux vm rm <id> [--json]
# aliases: cmux vm destroy <id>, cmux vm delete <id>
```

Permanently deletes the machine and its data through `vm.destroy`. Confirm the machine id before running this destructive command.

### `cmux vm status`

```bash
cmux vm status <id> [--json]           # alias: cmux vm info
```

Socket `vm.status`. Text: `<id>  [<provider>] <status>` and `image: <image>`. `--json`: `{id, provider, image, status, kind?, …}`. Sidebar: machine row › Status.

### `cmux vm stats`

```bash
cmux vm stats <id> [--json]            # alias: cmux vm top
```

Socket `vm.stats`. CPU, memory, and disk right now; a sleeping machine reports `asleep` and is not woken. `--json`: `{id, state: awake|asleep, cpu_percent, cpus, memory_used_mb, memory_total_mb, disk_used_mb, disk_total_mb}`. The router uses this to pick the least-loaded pool machine.

### `cmux vm resize`

```bash
cmux vm resize <id> [--cpu <1|2|…|32>] [--memory <4|5|…|64>G] [--disk <4|8|…|256>G] [--json]
```

Grows CPU, memory, and/or persistent disk on the existing machine. CPU accepts
1–32 vCPUs; memory accepts 4–64 GiB in whole-GiB steps; disk accepts 4–256 GiB
in 4 GiB steps. Supply at least one dimension. Omitted dimensions stay unchanged,
and every requested dimension must be at least its current size. Plan limits
can further restrict these ranges.

Socket `vm.resize` accepts `{id, cpu?, memory_mb?, storage_mb?}` and returns the
provider-confirmed `VMStats` object, including `cpus`, `memory_total_mb`, and
`disk_total_mb`. Text is `OK <id> cpu=<n> memory=<n> GiB disk=<n> GiB`; `--json`
returns the stats object. A resize can take a provider minute and consumes plan
resources, so confirm the machine and desired sizes before running it, then use
`cmux vm stats <id>` to verify the result. Sidebar: machine row › Resize machine
› Increase CPU / Increase Memory / Increase Disk uses the same action path.

### `cmux vm wait`

```bash
cmux vm wait <id> [--timeout <seconds>] [--wake] [--json]
```

Polls `vm.status` until the machine reports a ready status (`running`, `ready`, `standby`, `paused` — the same set the Machines panel calls ready); `--wake` then runs a trivial `vm.exec` so a sleeper is awake on return. Default timeout 180 s; exit 1 on timeout or a failed state. `--json`: the last status payload plus `{ok: true, waited_seconds, woke}`. Use this instead of polling `vm status` yourself.

### `cmux vm tools`

```bash
cmux vm tools <id> [--json]            # alias: cmux vm tool-inspector
```

A `vm.exec` probe: shell, and whether `zsh git gh htop btop node bun python3` are installed. `--json`: the exec payload `{stdout, stderr, exit_code}`.

### `cmux vm handoff`

```bash
cmux vm handoff <id> [--json]
```

Socket `vm.status`, printed as a short block (id, provider, status, `attach: cmux vm shell <id>`, `inspect: cmux vm tools <id>`) to paste to a person or another agent. `--json`: the status payload.

### Base: `cmux vm base open` / `cmux vm base reset`

```bash
cmux vm base [open] [--desktop|--base] [--workspace <workspace-id>] [--window <id|ref|index>] [--focus <true|false>] [--detach|-d] [--json]
cmux vm base reset [--desktop|--base] [--reason <text>] [--workspace <workspace-id>] [--window <id|ref|index>] [--detach|-d] [--json]
```

Base is the one pinned persistent machine per user. `open` (`vm.base_open`) reuses the same VM every time, creating it on first use with the devbox and displays (legacy kind flags are accepted without changing that choice); an existing Base keeps its image. `reset` (`vm.base_reset`) mints a new Base generation and retains the previous VM so an accidental reset is recoverable. Both open a plain terminal unless `--detach`; text `OK <id>`, `--json` the payload. Sidebar: Open Base / Set Up Base sheet.

## Public HTTPS domains

`cmux cloud` is an alias for `cmux vm`, so every command below also works with
`cmux vm domains`. A domain publication is the public-URL path; it is distinct
from `cmux vm open <id> <port>`, whose URL is private to the owner's WireGuard
tunnel.

### `cmux cloud domains`

```bash
cmux cloud domains --help
cmux cloud domains [list] [--json]
cmux cloud domains zones [--json]
cmux cloud domains verify <domain> [--json]
cmux cloud domains publish <vm> <port> [--domain <hostname>] [--access personal|team|public] [--team <id>] [--json]
cmux cloud domains access <hostname> <personal|team|public> [--team <id>] [--json]
cmux cloud domains rm <hostname> [--json]
```

All domain commands require the cmux app and a signed-in account. `list` (the
default) calls `vm.publication_list` and prints each publication's HTTPS URL,
VM/port, access mode, lifecycle state, routing revision, and verification state.
`--json` returns a stable `{publications: [...]}` object. `zones` calls
`vm.domain_list` and lists the custom zones owned by the account separately from
their publications; `--json` returns `{domains: [...]}`.

`publish` maps one VM port to one hostname. Omitting `--domain` asks cmux to
reserve a generated cmux hostname; it needs no customer DNS proof. Supplying a
custom hostname requires that its base zone has been verified first (the zone
itself or one immediate child is accepted). `port` must be 1–65535. Access
defaults to `personal`; `team` requires `--team <id>` and checks current team
membership; `public` allows anyone who has the URL. The command returns the
publication object, including `verification.dnsInstructions` when setup is not
complete.

`verify` is a zone-level operation, not a publication activation switch. The
first call creates or retrieves the pending ownership challenge and prints a
labelled DNS checklist. Add every record exactly as printed, wait for DNS and
certificate propagation, then run the same command again. The checklist normally
contains: an ownership TXT record, an apex routing alias/CNAME-flattening record,
the wildcard routing CNAME, and `_acme-challenge` NS delegation. A publication
hostname or publication id resolves to its owning zone; a generated cmux name
has nothing to verify and is rejected. A verified zone can serve the apex or one
label (`example.com` or `app.example.com`); deeper names need another covering
zone.

`access` changes an existing publication's policy in place. Its first argument
is the publication hostname (or id), not a VM id; pass `--team` only with
`team`. `rm` permanently unpublishes the hostname and removes its provider
route. Treat `public` URLs as bearer credentials: do not put them in logs,
commits, or unattended prompts. Policy changes take effect on subsequent
requests; they do not create per-viewer grants.

## Files

### `cmux vm push`

```bash
cmux vm push <id> <local-path> [remote-path] [--exclude <pattern>]... [--no-default-excludes] [--json]
# alias: cmux vm upload
```

The CLI calls `vm.scp_info` with a locally generated Ed25519 public key, then transfers bytes with OpenSSH/SFTP through the app's userspace WireGuard hub. Each grant request uses a fresh authenticated control connection. The guest host key comes from the authenticated backend response and is pinned for SSH. File content never enters exec commands. SHA-256 is checked before finalization; files preserve modes and directories merge into the destination. `.git`, `node_modules`, `.venv`, `__pycache__`, and `.DS_Store` are skipped unless `--no-default-excludes`; `--exclude` adds patterns. Relative paths use the `cmux` guest home. The 256 MiB limit remains. `vm.file_transfer_failure` sends only a phase, bounded failure category, and optional subprocess exit code to the signed-in app, which returns a copyable diagnostic reference. Text output gives a summary; `--json` returns `{ok, direction: "push", vm, local, remote, kind: file|directory, bytes, sha256, seconds, excluded?}`.

### `cmux vm pull`

```bash
cmux vm pull <id> <remote-path> [local-path] [--json]
# alias: cmux vm download
```

The reverse: file or directory back to local disk (defaults to the remote basename in the current directory). `--json`: `{ok, direction: "pull", vm, remote, local, kind, bytes, sha256, seconds}`.

## Execution

### `cmux vm exec`

```bash
cmux vm exec <id> [--json] -- <command...>
```

Socket `vm.exec {id, command}`. Each argv element is shell-quoted, then joined, so `-- printf '%s\n' "a b"` means what it says; wrap shell constructs as `-- sh -c '<script>'`. No TTY, no stdin, a ~30 s server-side cap (35 s client timeout): background long work (`nohup … > /tmp/x.log 2>&1 &`) and poll, or use `vm agent` / a session terminal. stdout and stderr pass through; a non-zero remote exit prints `exit <n>` and exits 1. `--json`: `{stdout, stderr, exit_code}` (still exit 1 when `exit_code != 0`). Sidebar: none (a person types into a pane).

### `cmux vm run`

```bash
cmux vm run [--sync] [--pull <remote-path>] [--machine <id>] [--new] [--size <4g|8g|16g|24g|32g|64g|MB>] [--timeout <seconds>] [--json] -- <command...>
```

Runs a command on a cloud machine **without naming one**: sticky binding for the caller's directory (`~/.cmuxterm/vm-run-bindings.json`, 14-day TTL) → idle awake pool machine, least-loaded by `vm.stats` → sleeping pool machine (exec wakes it) → provision a fresh pool machine (`vm.create {kind: base}`; the current manifest maps both kinds to the devbox with displays, labeled `agent-pool` via `vm.rename`, recorded in `~/.cmuxterm/vm-run-pool.json` under a cross-process `flock`, waited to ready) → at the plan cap, the least-loaded busy pool machine. Only machines the router itself provisioned are drafted; `--machine <id>` pins any machine, `--new` forces a fresh pool machine, `--size` applies to a machine this run creates. `--sync` pushes the current directory to `work/<basename>` first and runs there; `--pull <remote>` fetches that path back afterwards. `--timeout` default 600 s, max 15 minutes.
The routing decision goes to **stderr** (`[cmux vm run] <id> (<reason>)`); stdout is the command's own stdout; the remote **exit code passes through**. `--json`: `{ok, machine, created, exit_code, stdout, stderr, seconds, synced_to?, pulled_to?}`. Socket calls: `vm.list`, `vm.stats`, `vm.exec`, and on provision `vm.create`, `vm.rename`, `vm.status`.

## Routing

### `cmux vm route`

```bash
cmux vm route [--cwd <dir>] [--new] [--provision] [--size <4g|8g|16g|24g|32g|64g|MB>] [--json]
```

Prints the machine `vm run` / `vm agent` would use for a directory and why, without running anything (same policy, same `vm.list` + `vm.stats` calls). Text: `machine=<id> created=<bool>` and `reason: …`; when the pool is empty or busy it prints that `cmux vm run` would provision and stops — unless `--provision`, which creates the machine now. `--json`: `{machine (null when it would provision), created, reason, would_provision, directory}`. Exit 0 in every routed case.

### `cmux vm agent`

```bash
cmux vm agent --agent <claude|codex|opencode|pi> [--machine <id>] [--sync] [--cwd <dir>] [--name <name>] [--no-open] [--new] [--size <s>] [--json] -- <prompt or args...>
```

Starts a coding agent on a cloud machine chosen like `vm run` (or pinned with `--machine`) as a **detached terminal in the machine's cmux-tui session**: `surface.new_terminal {machine, command, name, open}`, where the command is a login shell that starts in the remote `$HOME` and puts `$HOME/.npm-global/bin`, `$HOME/.bun/bin`, and `$HOME/.local/bin` first. The daemon supplies its own home; the CLI does not send a hard-coded `cwd`. A bare prompt uses the agent's one-shot form (`claude -p`, `codex exec`, `opencode run`, `pi -p`); args that start with a flag or a known subcommand (`codex exec …`, `claude --resume …`) pass through verbatim. `--sync` pushes `--cwd` (default: the current directory) to `work/<basename>` first and starts the agent there; `--name` sets the terminal's name in the tree (default `<agent>: <prompt…>`); `--no-open` starts it without a pane. The command returns as soon as the terminal starts.
Text: `Started <agent> on <machine> — terminal <term> in workspace <ws> …`, `Reattach: cmux vm open <machine>/<ws>/<term>`, and `OK surface=… terminal=… workspace=…` when a pane opened. `--json`: `{ok, machine, created, reason, agent, command, name, terminal_id, workspace_id, cwd, reattach, surface_id?}`. Credentials: the agent authenticates inside the machine the way it would locally (its own login under the remote `$HOME`, or `cmux ai-accounts upload` for the team's subrouter).

## Workspaces and terminals (the machine's cmux-tui session)

Every machine runs the cmux-tui remote daemon: its own workspaces (`ws_…`) → terminals (`term_…`). Terminals keep running detached; panes on the Mac merely project them.

### `cmux vm tab rename` and `cmux vm terminal rename`

```bash
cmux vm tab rename <machine> <tab-id> <name>
cmux vm terminal rename <machine> <terminal-id> <name>
```

`vm.tab_rename` changes one exact tab placement; `vm.terminal_rename` fans a
label change out to every placement of that terminal. Pass an empty quoted name
(`""`) to clear the custom label. These are the shared rename paths used by
the sidebar and preserve the distinction between a tab and a terminal identity.

### `cmux vm tree`

```bash
cmux vm tree [<machine>|local] [--refresh] [--json]
```

Socket `surface.catalog {machine?, refresh?}` (plus `workspace.list` to name local workspaces). The Finder-style view of every surface: **This Mac** first (terminals grouped by workspace, then browsers), then each cloud machine — its **Workspaces**, **Ports**, **VNC Displays**, and final **Terminals** index. Workspace rows carry each terminal's title, cwd, lifecycle, agent state, and existing pane projections; every line carries an address `cmux vm open` or `cmux surface open` accepts. `--refresh` re-syncs every provider first. `--json`: `{machines: [{id, local, name, status, image, has_desktop, memory_mb, disk_mb, link_state, link_error, cpu_percent, memory_used_mb, disk_used_mb}], resources: [{id, machine, kind: terminal|display|browser, key, title, detail, lifecycle, agent, remote_workspace, port, url, open, open_surface_ids, open_workspace_ids}], projections: [{resource, workspace_id, surface_id}]}`. Same as `cmux surface ls`. Sidebar: the Cloud tree itself; machine row › Refresh.

```

The sidebar shows the same tree in the same order: the machine's **Workspaces**
group first (always its own row, with a ＋ that is `vm workspace new`), then
**Ports**, **VNC Displays**, and the final **Terminals** index (attached rows
plus a greyed detached subgroup). Every sidebar verb has a CLI verb — see
[sidebar-parity.md](sidebar-parity.md). `<machine>/<workspace>` addresses take
the `ws_…` id, or the workspace name only when exactly one workspace has it
(colliding names need the id); an empty workspace still resolves, and `vm open`
starts a shell in it.

### `cmux vm workspace new`

```bash
cmux vm workspace new <machine> [--name <name>] [--json]
```

Socket `vm.workspace_new`: creates a workspace on the machine (its ⌘N, with a first terminal) and opens it as a new local workspace. Text `OK workspace=<local id> remote_workspace=<ws id> machine=<id>`. Sidebar: machine row › New Workspace; Workspaces ＋.

### `cmux vm workspace open`

```bash
cmux vm workspace open <machine> <workspace-id> [--here] [--tabs] [--workspace <local>] [--pane <id|ref> [--left|--right|--up|--down]] [--json]
```

Socket `vm.workspace_open`: the machine workspace's terminals and browsers as a **new local workspace**, one pane each (what clicking the row does). `--here` projects them into the current (or `--workspace`) local workspace instead — one pane at the destination, the rest as tabs ("Open All Here"); `--tabs` makes all of them tabs of the focused (or `--pane`) pane; `--pane <p>` + a side splits that pane on that side (dropping the row on a pane edge). Text `OK workspace=<local> opened=<n> machine=<id> [here]`. `<workspace-id>` is the `ws_…` id or an unambiguous workspace name, resolved exactly like the sidebar row; the payload's `remote_workspace_id` is the resolved id. An existing workspace with nothing in it opens nothing and answers `Nothing to open: …` with a `cmux vm open <machine>/<ws>` hint (that verb starts a terminal there). Also `cmux vm open <machine>/<ws>` for the workspace's focused terminal only.

### `cmux vm workspace rename`

```bash
cmux vm workspace rename <machine> <workspace-id> <name> [--json]
```

Socket `vm.workspace_rename`. Sidebar: workspace row › Rename….

### `cmux vm workspace close`

```bash
cmux vm workspace close <machine> <workspace-id> [--json]
```

Socket `vm.workspace_close`: closes the workspace; its terminals **keep running** in the machine's Terminals pool (plain rows there). CLI-only — the sidebar's single "Close Workspace…" is the full close (`vm workspace rm`).

### `cmux vm workspace rm`

```bash
cmux vm workspace rm <machine> <workspace-id> [--json]     # alias: cmux vm workspace delete
```

Socket `vm.workspace_delete`: kills every terminal viewed in the workspace, then closes it. Permanent. Text `OK deleted workspace <ws> on <machine> (<n> terminals closed)`. Sidebar: workspace row › Close Workspace… and its hover × (confirms only when there is something to kill).

### `cmux vm terminal close`

```bash
cmux vm terminal close <machine> <terminal-id> [--json]
```

Socket `vm.terminal_close`: ends a terminal on the machine (the process and its tab); every local pane showing it closes too. Sidebar: terminal row › Close Terminal / hover ×.

### `cmux vm terminal send`

```bash
cmux vm terminal send <machine> <terminal-id> [text] [--keys <k1,k2,…>] [--json]    # alias: cmux vm terminal write
cmux vm terminal send <machine> <terminal-id> -- 'text that starts with --keys'
```

Socket `vm.terminal_write {id, terminal_id, text?, keys?}` (cmux-tui `terminal <id> write` / `keys`): types `text` into the machine terminal exactly as given (no newline), then presses the named keys — `enter`, `tab`, `escape`, `up`, `down`, …; chords join with `+` (`ctrl+c`). `--keys enter` alone presses Enter; give text and/or `--keys`. Headless: no pane is attached or focused, and every pane already projecting the terminal shows the input. Put `--` before text that contains this command's own flags. Text `OK sent <n> chars [+ keys …] to <term> on <machine>`; `--json`: the payload (`{wrote, …}`). Sidebar: none by design (a person types into the pane).

### `cmux vm terminal read`

```bash
cmux vm terminal read <machine> <terminal-id> [--json]    # alias: cmux vm terminal screen
```

Socket `vm.terminal_read {id, terminal_id}` (cmux-tui `terminal <id> screen read`): the terminal's visible screen as text — what a person at that terminal sees. `--json`: `{text, rows, cols, cursor_row, cursor_col, cursor_visible}`.

### `cmux vm terminal wait`

```bash
cmux vm terminal wait <machine> <terminal-id> --pattern <regex> [--timeout <seconds>] [--json]
```

Socket `vm.terminal_wait {id, terminal_id, pattern, timeout_ms}` (cmux-tui `terminal <id> screen wait`): blocks until the screen text matches the regex. `--timeout` is seconds (default 30, 0.001–3600; out of range is an error). Text `OK matched /<pattern>/ on <term>`; `--json`: `{matched, text, …}`. Exit 1 with the screen tail on timeout.

The headless loop for any interactive program on a machine (a REPL, a TUI, a long test run, another agent's session): `cmux surface new-terminal --machine <m> --no-open -- <cmd>` (or `vm agent --no-open`), then `terminal send … --keys enter`, `terminal wait … --pattern '…'`, `terminal read …`. Open a pane for the person only when there is something to show.

### `cmux vm prompt`

```bash
cmux vm prompt [--json]                # alias: cmux vm skill
cmux vm prompt --open <claude|codex|opencode>
```

Bootstraps an agent that has **no skill loaded**: `vm.cloud_prompt` installs the app-bundled cmux-cloud skill file at `~/.config/cmux/skills/cmux-cloud.md` and prints the kickoff prompt that points any agent at it (the skill path goes to stderr; `--json`: `{prompt, skill_path}`). `--open <agent>` (`vm.cloud_agent_open`) opens a local terminal running that agent with the prompt (`OK opened <agent> … (terminal=<surface>)`; `--json`: `{surface_id|terminal_id, …}`). Sidebar: control bar › Copy Cloud Prompt / Open Cloud Agent.

## Surfaces and display

A **surface** is a terminal, VNC screen, or browser on This Mac or on a machine, with a stable id `<machine>/<kind>/<key>` (`local/terminal/<uuid>`, `vivid-newt/terminal/term_2f9c…`, `vivid-newt/display/display:1`, `vivid-newt/browser/port:3000`). Panes project surfaces; closing a pane never kills a machine's terminal.

### `cmux vm shell`

```bash
cmux vm shell <id> [--window <id|ref|index>] [--json]    # alias: cmux vm attach
```

A **plain terminal** on the machine, like an ssh session (not the cmux-tui client): one shared open path — `vm.cmux_remote_info` (availability and protocol check), `workspace.create` (or `workspace.cloud_vm_terminal_ready` for `--workspace`), `workspace.cloud_vm_bind`, then `surface.new_terminal {machine, open: true, name: "shell"}`, which creates a `bash -l` terminal in the machine's session and projects it as a pane; the placeholder pane is closed with `surface.close`. Desktop machines also get their screen in a split (`vm.desktop_open`). Text `OK workspace=<ws> transport=cmux-remote terminal=<term>` plus `Reattach: cmux vm open <m>/<ws>/<term>`; `--json` adds `terminal_id`, `remote_workspace_id`, `surface_id`. Every other cloud open (`vm new`, `vm fork`, `vm restore`, `vm base open`, the Machines panel, the sidebar cloud button) uses this path. Older deployments without a cmux-tui daemon fall back to the websocket/SSH transports (`vm.attach_info`, `vm.session_attach_info`, `vm.sessions`); a machine that answers `vm_attach_transport_unsupported` is cmux-tui only. Sidebar: machine row › Open Shell / click.

### `cmux vm tui`

```bash
cmux vm tui <id> [--window <id|ref|index>] [--json]
```

Opens the full cmux-tui client in a pane, with its own workspaces, panes, and tabs. It dials the machine's trusted-carrier listener over the private network, so it does not perform device enrollment or approval. The hidden `vm-tui-connect --config <file>` helper is used only by this command. Use `vm shell` for a plain terminal.

### `cmux vm open`

```bash
cmux vm open <target> [--workspace <id|ref|index>] [--focus <true|false>] [--print] [--json]
cmux vm open <id> <port> [--print] [--json]
```

One resolver, several target shapes (copy them from `cmux vm tree`):

| Target | Does | Socket |
|---|---|---|
| `<machine>` | the machine's shell — exactly `cmux vm shell <machine>` | see `vm shell` |
| `<machine>/<ws>` (`ws_…` id or workspace name) | that workspace's focused/first live terminal, or a new terminal there when it is empty (`OK terminal=… workspace=… surface=…`) | `surface.catalog`, `surface.project` / `surface.new_terminal {machine, remote_workspace_id, open}` |
| `<machine>/<ws>/<term_…>` | one terminal; reuses the pane already showing it (`reused=true`) | `surface.project {resource: "<m>/terminal/<term>", workspace_id?, focus?}` |
| `<machine>:desktop` | the noVNC screen as a browser pane — same as `cmux vm desktop` (desktop-kind machines only) | `vm.desktop_open` |
| `<machine>:port/<n>` and `<machine> <n>` | an HTTP port on the machine, as a browser pane — the URL is the machine's private VPC address, so it needs `cmux vpn up` | `vm.port_open {id, port, workspace_id?}` |
| `… --print` | ports only: mint and print the URL, no pane | `vm.open_port {id, port}` → `{open_url, …}` |

`--workspace` targets a local workspace (default: the machine's open workspace, else where you are); `--focus` defaults to false so the pane opens beside you without stealing typing. Text `OK surface=… workspace=… terminal=… [reused=true]`; ports print `<id>:<port>` and the URL. Anything else is a usage error (exit 1). `cmux vm port` is an alias for the verb. Sidebar: row click / Open; Port row click.

### `cmux vm desktop`

```bash
cmux vm desktop <id> [--workspace <id|ref|index>] [--json]    # alias: cmux vm vnc
```

Socket `vm.desktop_open {id, workspace_id?, focus: false}`: the machine's noVNC desktop as a browser pane in the machine's open workspace, else the one you name, else where you are (focus defaults to false so the pane never steals typing from the shell). The pane opens the machine's **private address on 6901** over the owner's private network — `cmux vpn up` first, like every other access verb. Text `OK surface=… url=…`. Machines with a screen only; historical shell-only images have none (exit 1). New machines include displays even when created with a legacy `--base` flag. Sidebar: machine row › Open Desktop; Displays › Open Desktop.

### `cmux vm ssh`

```bash
cmux vm ssh <id> [--window <id|ref|index>] [--json]
```

Opens the provider SSH-backed workspace through the app's SSH attach path. This compatibility path is provider-dependent; the normal cloud terminal path is `vm shell`.

### Provider attach diagnostics

```bash
cmux vm ssh-info <id> [--json]
cmux vm ssh-attach <id>
```

`ssh-info` reports provider SSH details when an image exposes them; the default
cmux transport may have no SSH endpoint. The app also exposes the internal
`vm.diagnostics` socket method for provider attach diagnostics. `ssh-attach` is an internal helper
used by the app's attach surface and is not normally invoked by an agent.

### `cmux surface ls`

```bash
cmux surface ls [<machine>|local] [--refresh] [--json]   # aliases: cmux surface list, cmux surface tree, cmux surface catalog
```

Socket `surface.catalog` — exactly `cmux vm tree`, including This Mac.

### `cmux surface open`

```bash
cmux surface open <resource> [--workspace <id|ref|index>] [--pane <id|ref>] [--left|--right|--up|--down|--tab] [--new] [--focus <true|false>] [--json]
# alias: cmux surface project
```

Socket `surface.project {resource, workspace_id?, pane_id?, direction?, placement?, reuse?, focus?}` → `{surface_id, workspace_id, reused, resource}`: puts one surface in a pane through the single open path. Reuses the pane already showing the resource unless `--new`; `--pane` + a side splits that pane on that side, `--tab` adds a tab to it, otherwise the workspace's focused pane; a local terminal moves to the destination (it can be shown once). Text `OK surface=… workspace=… resource=… [reused=true]`. Sidebar: row click, Open in New Tab, Open in New Pane, drag onto a pane edge.

### `cmux surface new-terminal`

```bash
cmux surface new-terminal --machine <id|local> [--cwd <dir>] [--name <name>] [--remote-workspace <ws_…>] [--workspace <id|ref|index>] [--no-open] [--json] [-- <command...>]
# alias: cmux surface new
```

Socket `surface.new_terminal {machine, command?, cwd?, name?, remote_workspace_id?, open?, workspace_id?}` → `{resource, terminal_id, machine, remote_workspace_id, workspace_id?, surface_id?}`: a terminal on the machine through its provider (cloud terminals land in the machine's cmux-tui session; `--remote-workspace` picks which; `local` is a new shell on This Mac), opened as a pane unless `--no-open`. Sidebar: Terminals / Workspaces › New Terminal; workspace row › New Terminal Here.

## Checkpoints and forks

Provider-dependent: `cmux vm ls --json` → `capabilities.snapshot` / `capabilities.fork` say whether a machine supports them; the sidebar hides the verbs on providers that cannot.

### `cmux vm snapshot`

```bash
cmux vm snapshot <id> [--name <name>] [--json]    # alias: cmux vm checkpoint
```

Socket `vm.snapshot {id, name?}`. Text `OK snapshot=<snapshot id>`; `--json` the payload (`snapshot_id` or `id`). Sidebar: machine row › Checkpoint.

### `cmux vm fork`

```bash
cmux vm fork <id> [--name <name>] [--window <id|ref|index>] [--detach|-d] [--json]
```

Socket `vm.fork {id, name?, idempotency_key}`: clones a machine as a new tracked machine for a parallel experiment. `--detach` prints `OK <id>` with provider, image, and snapshot (`native fork` when the provider forks without one); otherwise opens the new machine's shell. Sidebar: machine row › Fork. (Not to be confused with `cmux fork`, a local agent-session verb — see In flight.)

### `cmux vm restore`

```bash
cmux vm restore <snapshot-id> [--provider <provider>] [--window <id|ref|index>] [--detach|-d] [--json]
```

Socket `vm.restore {snapshot_id, provider?, idempotency_key}`: a snapshot as a new tracked machine; opens its shell unless `--detach`.

### `cmux vm promote-template`

```bash
cmux vm promote-template <id> [--json]
```

Socket `vm.snapshot` with a template-oriented name (`template-<id>-<unix time>`). Text `OK template=<snapshot id>`.

## Networking and ports

### `cmux vm ports`

```bash
cmux vm ports <id> [--json]
```

A `vm.exec` of `ss -ltnp` (or `netstat -ltnp`): the TCP ports listening **inside** the machine. `--json`: the exec payload.

### Port URLs: `cmux vm open <id> <port>`

See `vm open`: `cmux vm open <id> 3000` opens an HTTP port on the machine as a browser pane (`vm.port_open`); `--print` only mints and prints the URL (`vm.open_port`, `--json` → `{open_url, …}`). The URL points at the machine's **private VPC address** — reachable only through the owner's WireGuard tunnel (`cmux vpn up`), never a public ingress; the daemon's own port is refused, and the lease carries an expiry. Only share URLs minted this way; never guess provider URLs (they resolve for the machine's owner only).

## Account and plan

### `cmux vpn`

```bash
cmux vpn up          # enroll this Mac on first run, bring the WireGuard tunnel up (wg-quick, prompts for sudo; brew install wireguard-tools)
cmux vpn down        # tunnel down; enrollment kept
cmux vpn status      # tunnel state, config path, backend
cmux vpn on           # alias for up
cmux vpn off          # alias for down
cmux vpn revoke       # tunnel down + unenroll (server deletes its side)
```

The tunnel between this Mac and the private Cloud VM network. Config lives under `~/.cmuxterm/wireguard/` — **one tunnel per deployment** (interface `cmux` for production, `cmux-staging`/`cmux-local`/`cmux-dev` for other API origins), so a dev build and the production app can both be up side by side. The private key is generated on this Mac and never leaves it. Run `up` once per boot before the attach/exec/port verbs; a stale tunnel (another enrollment's keys — `vpn status` reports it) is replaced by `up` instead of read as up.

`hosts` reads `vm.list` and publishes `<machine>.internal` names (id slug, plus the display label when it differs) system-wide, so browsers and curl resolve them whenever the tunnel is up — a manual convenience for you and the user; the verbs themselves use raw addresses. `up` re-syncs the block quietly on success, so run `hosts` yourself mainly right after `cmux vm new`; `--json` answers `{hosts_changed, machine_count}`.

### `cmux auth`

```bash
cmux auth status [--json]              # {signed_in, …}; socket auth.status
cmux auth login                        # alias: cmux login — opens the sign-in popup (auth.begin_sign_in / auth.sign_in_url) and waits
cmux auth logout                       # alias: cmux logout — auth.sign_out
```

Every `cmux vm` verb requires a signed-in app.

### Plan meter and limits

`cmux vm self` prints `N of M machines on the <plan> plan` when the plan carries a cap, or `N machines on the <plan> plan, no limit` when it does not — the cap is whatever the backend sends (`cmux vm ls --json` → `limits`: `maxActiveVms?`, `planId`, `memoryOptionsMb?`, `freeAccessExpiresAt` when a free window applies); plan tiers and their caps change on the pricing page, so read them from `limits`, never from memory. **Provisioning is gated to paid plans**: `vm new`, a first `vm base open`, `base reset`, `fork`, `restore`, and the router's provisioning path return the `vm_requires_pro` error (with the pricing link) on free or unknown plans. Report caps and gates — never delete machines to make room without asking. A parsed size not present in `memoryOptionsMb` resolves to the plan default; inspect the create result or `vm stats` rather than assuming the request was honored.

### `cmux ai-accounts`

```bash
cmux ai-accounts list [--team <id>] [--json]
cmux ai-accounts upload <claude|codex|anthropic-key|openai-key> [--label <s>] [--key <s>] [--team <id>] [--validate] [--json]
cmux ai-accounts remove <account-id> [--team <id>] [--json]
```

Sockets `aiAccounts.list` / `aiAccounts.upload` / `aiAccounts.remove`: uploads local AI credentials to the team's subrouter tenant so agents started with `vm agent` can authenticate on a machine without copying tokens onto it. Only on the user's say-so.

### `cmux capabilities` and `cmux rpc`

```bash
cmux capabilities                      # socket system.capabilities: every method the app serves, including the vm.* and surface.* set below
cmux rpc <method> [json-params]        # call any v2 method directly, e.g. cmux rpc vm.stats '{"id":"brave-otter"}'
```

## Socket methods (the app's `vm.*` / cloud `surface.*` set)

| Method | CLI verb |
|---|---|
| `vm.list` | `vm ls` |
| `vm.create` | `vm new`, and `vm run` / `vm route --provision` / `vm agent` when they provision |
| `vm.base_open`, `vm.base_reset` | `vm base open`, `vm base reset` |
| `vm.status` | `vm status`, `vm handoff`, `vm wait` |
| `vm.stats` | `vm stats`; the router's load scoring |
| `vm.diagnostics` | `cmux rpc vm.diagnostics '{}'` returns the app's cloud-operation report; `{"show":true}` also opens the diagnostics window |
| `vm.resize` | `vm resize <id> [--cpu …] [--memory …] [--disk …]`; machine row › Resize machine |
| `vm.rename` | `vm new --name` and the router's `agent-pool` label; direct machine-label editing is currently a sidebar action |
| `vm.tab_rename` | `vm tab rename` |
| `vm.terminal_rename` | `vm terminal rename` |
| `vm.publication_grant`, `vm.publication_grants`, `vm.publication_ungrant` | publication viewer grant management exposed by the Cloud publication controller |
| `vm.tunnel_config`, `vm.tunnel_up`, `vm.tunnel_down`, `vm.tunnel_status`, `vm.tunnel_wait`, `vm.tunnel_revoke` | WireGuard enrollment and lifecycle behind `cmux vpn up|down|status|on|off|revoke` |

| `vm.snapshot` | `vm snapshot`, `vm promote-template` |
| `vm.fork`, `vm.restore` | `vm fork`, `vm restore` |
| `vm.destroy` | Cloud sidebar machine deletion |
| `vm.exec` | `vm exec`, `vm run`, `vm push`, `vm pull`, `vm wait --wake`, `vm tools`, `vm ports` |
| `vm.open_port`, `vm.port_open` | `vm open <id> <port> --print`, `vm open <id> <port>` / `<id>:port/<n>` |
| `vm.desktop_open` | `vm desktop`, `vm open <id>:desktop`, the split beside `vm shell` |
| `vm.cmux_remote_info`, `vm.link_socket` | the shared machine shell and surface open path |
| `vm.ssh_info` | provider-specific attach diagnostics surfaced by the app |
| `vm.attach_info`, `vm.session_attach_info`, `vm.sessions` | legacy websocket/SSH attach transports the open path falls back to on deployments without a cmux-tui daemon (`cmux rpc` reaches them directly) |
| `vm.tree` | the pre-catalog tree; `vm tree` uses `surface.catalog` |
| `vm.terminal_open`, `vm.terminal_new` | older terminal verbs; `vm open <m>/<ws>/<term>` and `surface new-terminal` use `surface.project` / `surface.new_terminal` |
| `vm.workspace_new`, `vm.workspace_open`, `vm.workspace_rename`, `vm.workspace_close`, `vm.workspace_delete` | `vm workspace new|open|rename|close|rm` |
| `vm.terminal_close` | `vm terminal close` |
| `vm.terminal_write`, `vm.terminal_read`, `vm.terminal_wait` | `vm terminal send`, `vm terminal read`, `vm terminal wait` |
| `vm.cloud_prompt`, `vm.cloud_agent_open` | `vm prompt`, `vm prompt --open` |
| `vm.publication_list`, `vm.publication_create`, `vm.publication_verify`, `vm.publication_update`, `vm.publication_delete` | `cloud domains list`, `publish`, `access`, `rm`; `vm.publication_verify` is the app-side publication retry path |
| `vm.domain_list`, `vm.domain_verify` | `cloud domains zones`, `cloud domains verify` |
| `surface.catalog`, `surface.project`, `surface.new_terminal` | `vm tree` / `surface ls`, `surface open` / `vm open`, `surface new-terminal` / `vm agent` |

The authenticated public-domain workflow is **shipped on this branch**: use
`cmux cloud domains` for generated or custom HTTPS publications. `cmux vm open
<id> <port>` remains the private WireGuard preview path; it is not a substitute
for a domain publication.

### Current VM primitives

The current CLI also exposes these machine-scoped operations:

```bash
cmux vm self <id> [<path>] [--json]
cmux vm pause <id>
cmux vm resume <id>
cmux vm dev <id> [<folder>] [--name <workspace>] [--layout <file>] [--no-open]
cmux vm layout export <id> [<workspace>] [--raw]
cmux vm layout apply <id> <file>|- [--name <workspace>] [--workspace <empty-workspace>]
cmux vm env set <id> KEY=VALUE…
cmux vm terminal wait-exit <id> <terminal> [--timeout <seconds>]
cmux vm terminal output <id> <terminal> [--after <offset>]
```

## In flight

Verbs that exist only in an open PR. They are **not** on this branch; do not run them until the PR merges, at which point they move into the reference above.

- **#11609** (`freestyle-vm-primitives`) is the big one — everything below is on that branch and none of it is runnable here yet:
  - `cmux vm link <src> <dst>`: grant machine `<src>` a cmux-remote link to `<dst>` so the in-VM `cmux` on `<src>` drives `<dst>` directly (exec, tree, terminals) over the same transport the Mac uses. Grants are brokered by the Mac (route + single-use enrollment invitation it approves); no control-plane credential ever enters a VM, and a machine reaches only peers you linked. In-VM counterpart: `cmux vm connect <dst>`; the `vm` usage line gains `|link|`.
  - `vm tree --json` gains a top-level `workspaces` array (this Mac's `{id, title, ref, selected}`) and stops calling `workspace.list` separately; machine-level `remote_workspaces` and the Ports/Displays/detached-terminal rendering are already shipped here.
  - Placement hardening: `--tabs`/`--tab` combined with a pane side becomes an error, and an explicit `--workspace`/`--pane`/`--surface` that resolves to nothing answers `invalid_params` instead of silently falling back to the selected workspace.
  - The `vm handoff` attach line switches from the ssh verb to the shell verb.
  - A guest `cmux` shim is installed at `/usr/local/bin/cmux` inside every machine (a POSIX wrapper over the machine's cmux-tui): its `vm` namespace lists the peer verbs (`cmux vm help` there) and the links granted to that machine, and in-VM `cmux notify` reaches the user's Mac as data — shown on the pane displaying that terminal (128 B title / 1 KiB body caps, burst-limited; Mac selectors and `--reply` are ignored there).
  - The Mac dispatcher gains a `vm help` sub-verb (the shipped `vm domains --help` is separate), and the guest shim exposes the same help inside a machine.
  - **Headless staging lands as first-class flags**: `vm workspace new <m> --no-open` (socket `open: false`) stages a machine workspace without opening a local one, and `vm agent --remote-workspace <ws>` lands the agent's terminal in a staged workspace instead of the detached pool — replacing the close-the-local-workspace and `surface new-terminal … sh -lc` workarounds in [agent-workflows.md §6b](agent-workflows.md).
- **#11324** adds a top-level `cmux fork [--surface <id|ref>] <kind> <checkpoint-id>` that forks a persisted local **agent session** (the `cmux restore` family). It is not a cloud verb: the machine clone, `vm fork <id>`, is already in the reference above.
- **#11347** tracks the live sidebar ↔ CLI parity loop. Its port-row/tree work is shipped here; check the issue for any newer route/socket follow-ups before assuming a future flag is available. #11300 and #11301 were superseded by #11345, which is merged and reflected above (`vm terminal send|read|wait`, the single sidebar Close Workspace…).

## Discovery: the cloud tree

```bash
cmux auth status                       # host: signed in; guest: daemon/edge route health

```

Reflection (`https://coderouter.cmux.internal/api/vm/reflection`, also `https://reflection.cmux.internal/` on new machines) is how a machine identifies itself: the edge asserts the identity (the VM-bound route token), the guest holds no credential, and `/peers` lists the owner's other machines with their private routes so `cmux vm exec <peer>` works without any Mac step.

Tree line shapes:

```
vivid-newt  running  · 24 GB · 16 GB disk · link connected
  workspaces/                                  ← one machine, many workspaces: what you open and drag
    main  ws_3c1…  *  (cmux vm open vivid-newt/ws_3c1…)
      ● term_2f9…  bun test  ~/work/app  [agent claude running]  (open: surface:4)
      ○ term_88a…  bash                                  ← exited
    tests  ws_9ab…  (cmux vm open vivid-newt/ws_9ab…)   ← a second workspace on the same machine
  ports/
    3000  http  (cmux vm open vivid-newt:port/3000)
  VNC Displays/
    ● display:1  Desktop  noVNC  (cmux surface open vivid-newt/display/display:1)
  terminals/                                  ← every terminal resource the machine owns
    ● term_2f9…  bun test  ~/work/app             ← shown in a workspace
    (detached — no tab on the machine shows these)
      ● term_c04…  sleep 1000                   ← live, but in no workspace's layout
```

The sidebar shows the same tree in the same order: the machine's **Workspaces** group first (always its own row, with a ＋ that is `vm workspace new`; each workspace lists exactly its layout — a terminal whose tab closed is gone from the folder), then **Ports**, **VNC Displays** (one row per screen), and last, its own section, **Terminals** (every terminal resource the machine owns, detached ones greyed; always present, ＋ = `surface new-terminal`). Every sidebar verb has a CLI verb — see [sidebar-parity.md](sidebar-parity.md). `<machine>/<workspace>` addresses take the `ws_…` id, or the workspace name only when exactly one workspace has it (colliding names need the id); an empty workspace still resolves, and `vm open` starts a shell in it.

## Surfaces: one open path for terminals, screens and browsers

```bash
cmux surface open vivid-newt/terminal/term_2f9c…                 # reuse the pane showing it, else open beside you
cmux surface open vivid-newt/terminal/term_2f9c… --new           # a second pane on the same terminal
cmux surface open vivid-newt/display/display:1 --pane pane:3 --left   # the VNC screen, split left of pane 3
cmux surface open local/terminal/<uuid> --workspace workspace:2  # move a local terminal into another workspace
cmux surface new-terminal --machine vivid-newt --remote-workspace ws_3c1… --name "tests" -- bun test
cmux surface new-terminal --machine local --cwd ~/src/app        # a new local shell
```

Resource ids come from `surface ls --json`; `--pane` + a side uses the same drop rules as dragging a row from the sidebar.

## Routing: which machine, without running anything

```bash
cmux vm route                          # machine=<id> created=false / reason: reused, warm machine for this directory
cmux vm route --cwd ~/src/app --json   # {machine, created, reason, would_provision, directory}
cmux vm route --new --provision        # actually create the fresh pool machine the router would use
```

Policy (shared with `run` and `agent`): the machine bound to the directory → an awake idle pool machine → a sleeping pool machine → provision (only with `--provision` here) → at the plan cap, the least-loaded busy pool machine. Hand-made machines are never drafted. New cmux-created machines clear the provider idle timeout; a sleeping entry is an older/provider-managed or explicitly paused machine and is woken before an open operation.

## Lifecycle

```bash
cmux vm new --detach                   # new Desktop machine (screen + shell), headless create
cmux vm new --base --detach            # shell-only machine
cmux vm new --size 16g --detach        # memory preset: 2g|4g|8g|16g|24g|32g or raw MB (disk follows memory, 16 GB max)
cmux vm new --name "build box" --detach # display label; the id stays the address
cmux vm wait <id> [--timeout <sec>] [--wake]   # block until ready; --wake also wakes it
cmux vm rename <id> <label>            # display label; the id stays the address
cmux vm rename <id> --clear
cmux vm resume <id>                    # wake a paused machine (the same plan limits as a create apply)
cmux vm rm <id>                        # PERMANENT delete of machine + data (aliases: destroy, delete)
```

Without `--detach`, `vm new`, `vm fork`, and `vm restore` also open the machine as a workspace in the user's app.

## Base (the pinned persistent slot)

```bash
cmux vm base open                      # open (or create) the one persistent Base machine
cmux vm base reset --reason "fresh"    # new Base generation; the old VM is retained
```

## Running work

```bash
# routed (no machine id): sticky per directory, then an idle pool machine, then provision
cmux vm run -- <command...>
cmux vm run --sync -- bun test                 # push cwd to work/<basename>, run there
cmux vm run --sync --pull work/app/dist -- sh -c 'cd work/app && bun run build'
cmux vm run --machine <id> -- <command...>     # pin; --new forces a fresh pool machine
cmux vm run --size 16g --new -- <command...>   # size applies to machines this run creates

# a coding agent as a detached terminal in the machine's cmux-tui session
cmux vm agent --agent claude --sync -- "run the tests and fix failures"        # bare prompt → claude -p …
cmux vm agent --agent codex --machine <id> -- exec "summarize work/app"        # flag/subcommand-led args pass through
cmux vm agent --agent opencode --no-open --json -- "add a README"              # headless; {terminal_id, workspace_id, reattach}
cmux vm agent --agent pi --name "pi: docs" --cwd ~/src/app --sync -- "write docs for src/"
# agents: claude | codex | opencode | pi (preinstalled under /root/.npm-global/bin)
cmux vm agent --agent claude --machine <id> --wait --output --timeout 1800 -- "fix the failing tests"   # block until the agent exits, then print everything it wrote; its exit code passes through (1 on timeout/signal)
cmux vm run --machine <id> --wait --output -- sh -c 'bun test'    # accepted for symmetry: run already blocks on exec and prints the output

cmux vm exec <id> -- <command...>      # one command; remote exit code passes through; 30 s default cap
cmux vm exec <id> --timeout 600 -- <command...>   # up to 900 s for a build or a test run
cmux vm exec <id> --json -- ls -la     # {stdout, stderr, exit_code}
# long work: a durable terminal, then wait for exit and read the whole output
t=$(cmux surface new-terminal --machine <id> --no-open --json -- sh -c 'cd work/app && bun run build' | jq -r .terminal_id)
cmux vm terminal wait-exit <id> "$t" --timeout 900     # exited code=0 | exited signal=… | pending (exit 1)
cmux vm terminal output <id> "$t"                      # everything it printed; --json adds next_offset to resume from
```

### `vm dev`: a folder to a running dev layout in one verb

```bash
cmux vm dev <id>                                   # check machine + optional sync + detect command/port + layout apply --name + open
cmux vm dev <id> ~/src/app --name app --port 3000  # explicit folder, workspace name, and port
cmux vm dev <id> --command "make serve" --no-open  # override command; stage without opening a local pane
cmux vm dev <id> --layout dev.json --no-sync       # custom layout; skip the push
cmux vm dev <id> --dry-run --json                  # print the plan and JSON; zero socket traffic
cmux vm dev <id> --sync                            # force the folder push; --no-sync forces a machine-side checkout
```

Detection: `--command` wins; otherwise `package.json` (lockfile selects bun, pnpm, yarn, or npm; `dev` then `start`), `Cargo.toml` → `cargo run`, `go.mod` → `go run .`, `Makefile` with `dev:` → `make dev`, `manage.py` → `python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000`, `uv.lock` → `uv sync`, `pyproject.toml` → `pip install -e .`, `requirements.txt` → `pip install -r requirements.txt`, or `index.html` → `python3 -m http.server 8000`; otherwise the layout is shell-only. The port comes from `--port`, then `-p`/`--port`/`PORT=` in the script, then a framework default (Next/Nuxt/react-scripts 3000; Vite/SvelteKit/Remix 5173; Astro 4321; Angular 4200; Expo 8081; Wrangler 8787). The built-in layout is a horizontal split (0.62): the dev command on the left, a focused shell on the right, and a browser tab on `http://localhost:<port>` when a port is known. `vm dev` creates or reuses the workspace through `vm layout apply --name`; if it already has live terminals, the layout is kept and a second dev server is not started. `--no-open` prints the workspace-open command. The `next:` lines are the `terminal output` / `terminal send` commands for the dev terminal.

## Files

```bash
cmux vm push <id> <local-path> [remote-path]        # file or directory (tarball), SHA-256 verified
cmux vm push <id> ./site --exclude dist             # extra excludes on top of defaults
cmux vm push <id> ./repo --no-default-excludes      # include .git, node_modules, ...
cmux vm pull <id> <remote-path> [local-path]        # file or directory back to local disk
cmux vm push --secret <id> ./id_ed25519 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 [--mode 600]   # ONE file that must never transit exec: over the machine's link into `cmux file receive` (0600 by default, 256 KiB cap)
cmux vm push <id> ./site work/site --watch [--interval 1]              # keep copying on change (mtime/size scan, same excludes); remote-only files are preserved; Ctrl-C exits 0
```

Aliases: `upload` / `download`. Transfers ride the exec channel (no SSH), chunked base64, 256 MB cap; directories travel as tarballs and merge into the destination. Remote paths are relative to the work user's home (on the persistent volume). `--secret` is the exception: like `vm env set`, it goes Mac → app → the machine's cmux-tui link → a receiver terminal (`cmux file receive <path>`) that turns echo off before it reads, writes to a temp file next to the destination and moves it into place atomically. Nothing appears in a command line, the control plane, the provider API, a screen or scrollback. It refuses directories and `--exclude`; use it for keys, tokens, kubeconfigs, `.npmrc` and the like.

## Layouts (the shape of a machine workspace)

```bash
cmux vm layout export <id> [<ws-id|name>] [--raw] [--json]   # {"name","cwd","layout": Node}; default: the focused workspace; --raw: the daemon LayoutDocument (pane/tab ids, split ids)
cmux vm layout apply <id> <file>|- [--name <n>] [--cwd <dir>] [--open] [--json]   # build a NEW workspace from the document; --open shows it here with the same geometry
cmux vm layout apply <id> <file> --workspace <ws-id>          # into an already-empty workspace; a non-empty one is refused. `vm workspace new --no-open` creates a starter shell, so prefer `--name` or `vm dev`.
cmux vm layout apply <id> --from-saved <name> [--open]        # a Mac saved layout (`cmux layout save <name>`), applied in the cloud
```

Document (identical to `cmux new-workspace --layout`, `cmux layout get`, cmux.json workspaces):

```json
{"name": "app", "cwd": "work/app",
 "layout": {"direction": "horizontal", "split": 0.6, "children": [
   {"pane": {"surfaces": [{"type": "terminal", "name": "agent", "command": "claude"}]}},
   {"direction": "vertical", "split": 0.5, "children": [
     {"pane": {"surfaces": [{"type": "terminal", "name": "tests", "command": "bun test --watch"},
                            {"type": "terminal", "name": "logs", "cwd": "logs"}]}},
     {"pane": {"surfaces": [{"type": "browser", "url": "http://localhost:3000"}]}}]}]}}
```

- Wrappers accepted: the bare `layout` node, `{"name","cwd","env","layout"}`, or a saved layout `{"name","description","workspace":{…}}`.
- `horizontal` = side by side (first child left), `vertical` = stacked (first child top); `split` = the first child's share, 0.1–0.9 (default 0.5).
- Surface: `type` terminal|browser (`project` is Mac-only and skipped with a warning), `name` (tab name), `cwd` (relative to the document `cwd`, default: the work user's home), `env` (process environment of that shell), `command` (typed into the shell, then Enter — the shell survives it), `url` (browser), `focus`.
- Every terminal is a login shell (`bash -l`), so `vm env` values and the agents' PATH apply. Output: `OK workspace=ws_… name=… panes=N surfaces=M` or `--json` `{workspace_id, workspace_name, panes:[{pane_id, surfaces:[{type, terminal_id|browser_id, tab_id, name}]}], warnings}`.
- The same verb exists inside the machine (`cmux layout export|apply`) and toward linked peers (`cmux vm layout … <peer>`); the Mac form runs that implementation over the exec channel. A machine whose shim predates it says so (reconnect: `cmux vm tree <id> --refresh`).
- Exit codes: 0 built; 1 daemon refused (message names the op); 2 invalid document (message names the JSON path, e.g. `$.children[1]`) — nothing is created on a 2.

## Environment (project secrets and settings on a machine)

```bash
cmux vm env set <id> KEY=VALUE [KEY2=VALUE2 …]        # ~/.config/cmux/env (0600) in the work user's home on the persistent volume
cmux vm env set <id> --from-file .env                 # dotenv rules: blank and # lines skipped, optional `export `, matching quotes stripped
cmux vm env set <id> -                                # KEY=VALUE lines on stdin (preferred for scripts: nothing in argv)
cmux vm env ls <id> [--show] [--json]                 # names; --show adds values; --json {path, keys, values?}
cmux vm env rm <id> KEY [KEY2 …]
```

Values are sourced by every login/interactive shell on the machine (a one-line hook in `~/.profile` and `~/.bashrc`, installed on first `set`), so every terminal cmux starts (`vm open`, `surface new-terminal`, `vm agent`, layout panes), `vm exec`, and the in-VM `cmux agent …` see them. Keys must match `[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*`.

Transport: `vm env set` is the one `vm` verb that does **not** ride `vm.exec`. Values go to the app over the local socket and from there over the machine's cmux-tui link (Noise-authenticated end to end, on the private WireGuard network) into the machine's `cmux env receive`: a receiver terminal turns PTY echo off, prints `CMUX-ENV-READY`, reads base64 lines until `CMUX-ENV-END`, writes `~/.config/cmux/env` (0600), and answers `CMUX-ENV-OK keys=<n>`; the sender closes the terminal. So a value is never in a command line, never in the control plane or the provider API, never on a screen or in scrollback (the daemon does not journal input), and `ls` never prints one without `--show`. Inside a machine, `cmux vm env set <peer> …` uses the same handshake toward a linked peer. Snapshots, forks, and templates carry the file (it lives in the work user's home): `cmux vm env rm` what must not travel before `vm promote-template`. A machine whose shim predates the verb is reported as such (reconnect: `cmux vm tree <id> --refresh`).

## Opening things for the human (`vm open`)

```bash
cmux vm open <id>                      # the machine's shell (same as `vm shell`); desktop machines also get their screen beside it
cmux vm open <id>/<ws>                 # a cmux-tui workspace (ws_… id or name): its focused terminal, or a new shell if empty
cmux vm open <id>/<ws>/<term_…>        # one terminal — focuses the pane already showing it instead of opening a second
cmux vm open <id>:desktop              # the noVNC screen as a browser pane (also: `cmux vm desktop <id>`)
cmux vm open <id>:port/3000            # private tokened URL for an HTTP port, as a browser pane
cmux vm open <id> 3000                 # same as :port/3000
cmux vm open <id> 3000 --print         # URL only, no pane
cmux vm open … --workspace <ws> --focus true   # target a local workspace; focus the new pane (default: open beside you)
cmux vm shell <id>                     # a plain terminal on the machine (like ssh): one terminal in its cmux-tui session, attached in a pane
cmux vm tui <id>                       # the FULL cmux-tui client in a pane (its own workspaces/panes) — only when you want the client itself
```

`vm open` prints `OK surface=… workspace=… terminal=… [reused=true]`; `--json` prints the socket payload.

## Checkpoints, forks, templates

```bash
cmux vm snapshot <id> [--name <name>]  # checkpoint; prints the snapshot id (alias: checkpoint)
cmux vm snapshot ls <id> [--json]      # this machine's snapshots, newest first: <id>\t<created>\t<name|->
cmux vm snapshot rm <id> <snapshot-id> # delete one (only a snapshot of THIS machine; a later `vm restore` of it answers not found)
cmux vm fork <id> [--name <n>] [--detach]      # clone for a parallel experiment
cmux vm restore <snapshot-id> [--detach]       # snapshot -> new tracked machine
cmux vm promote-template <id>          # template-named snapshot for reuse
```

## Machine-to-machine links

owner's other machines with their private daemon routes, and the daemon's
private-network listener is a trusted carrier (every member of the network is the
owner's Mac or machine), so `cmux vm exec <dst> -- <command>` connects with the route
alone — no Mac step, no enrollment, no credential in the guest. Peer route files written
by the earlier `vm link` broker keep working and take precedence. From inside a
machine the installed `cmux` shim can run `cmux vm exec <dst> -- <command>`,
`cmux vm tree <dst>`, `cmux vm terminal send|read|wait|close <dst> <term> …`,
`cmux vm terminal send <dst> <term> <keys…>`, `cmux vm workspace new|rename|close|rm <dst> …`,
`cmux vm agent <dst> --agent <a> [--name <n>] [--cwd <dir>] -- <prompt>` (a durable
terminal on the peer running `cmux agent <a> …` with the peer's own CodeRouter config),
`cmux vm layout export|apply <dst> …`, `cmux vm env set|ls|rm <dst> …`, and
`cmux vm push <dst> <file> <remote-path>` (one file over the link, never through exec);
`cmux vm agent <dst> … --wait --output` blocks until the peer's agent exits and prints what
it wrote. No control-plane credential enters a machine.

## SSH (provider-dependent)

```bash
cmux vm ssh <id>                       # cmux-managed SSH workspace (not on every provider)
cmux vm ssh-info <id>                  # raw SSH endpoint details when available
```

The default cmux Cloud provider attaches through the cmux-tui remote daemon, not SSH — when `ssh` errors, use `exec`, `agent`, or `open` instead.

### Arrange the view from inside the machine

Use these commands in a daemon terminal (`cmux tree --json` supplies workspace,
screen, pane, split and tab IDs):

```bash
cmux workspace rename <ws> "Review ready"
cmux terminal rename current "Builder" --json
cmux tab rename <tab> "Test results" --json
cmux pane split <pane> right --ratio 0.6 --json
cmux tab move <tab> --workspace <ws> --screen <screen> --pane <destination-pane> --index 0 --json
cmux pane swap <pane> --other-workspace <ws> --other-screen <screen> --other-pane <other-pane> --json
cmux pane resize <pane> --split <split> --ratio 0.65 --json
cmux workspace move <ws> --index 0
cmux tab focus <tab>
cmux notify --title "Review ready" --body "The workspace has the app, logs, and test results."
```

`tab rename` labels one placement; `terminal rename` labels every current placement
of that terminal. Names, including spaces and an empty string, are passed as exact
arguments. A terminal with several views should be moved by its tab ID. Moving,
renaming, swapping, and changing split ratios preserve running terminal processes.
`pane resize` changes layout geometry. Machine resource resizing uses `vm resize` and preserves the existing VM identity and data.

Local commands use `cmux <resource> <verb> …`; a peer uses
`cmux vm <resource> <verb> <machine> …` (for example,
`cmux vm tab rename <machine> <tab> "Logs"`). Existing ID-first daemon syntax is
also supported. `cmux workspace help` lists the full topology grammar.

Arrange the daemon workspace before presenting it. The Mac's
`cmux vm workspace open <machine> <ws>` reads that layout when creating its local
view. These guest commands do not force focus or rearrange an already-open Mac
projection. `layout apply` is for new/empty workspaces; use the commands above to
change an occupied workspace without restarting its agents.
